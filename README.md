This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Pics

Sample react project, 

**Note worthy is the use of the grid system , to
automatically get a group of images to sit nicely
with each other even though they can be different
heights.

* Nice use of using ref's to get dom information
of an image height to dynamically set css, adding
the load event to an image to ensure we have access
to the all the images properties.

** Nice use of unsplash api, to fetch and search images.
